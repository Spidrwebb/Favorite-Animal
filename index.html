    </div>
    <p> Penguins are a group of aquatic flightless birds from the order Sphenisciformes (/sfɪˈnɪsəfɔːrmiːz/) of the
        family Spheniscidae (/sfɪˈnɪsɪdiː, -daɪ/).[4] They live almost exclusively in the Southern Hemisphere: only one
        species, the Galápagos penguin, is found north of the Equator. Highly adapted for life in the ocean water,
        penguins have countershaded dark and white plumage and flippers for swimming. Most penguins feed on krill, fish,
        squid and other forms of sea life which they catch with their bills and swallow whole while swimming. A penguin
        has a spiny tongue and powerful jaws to grip slippery prey.[5] </p>
